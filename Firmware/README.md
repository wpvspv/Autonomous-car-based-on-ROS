1. Requirements
- required hardwares : arduino, raspberry pi4
- required software : ubuntu18.04 & ros-melodic on raspberry pi4

2. How to use

- Arduino : Just download the code. That's it.
- Raspberry pi 4 : First of all, you must have installed ros-melodic on the board. Then, copy the raspberry_arduino package under ~/catkin_ws/src.
While compiling, there could happend several errors but unfortunately, "Do-It-Yourself".
